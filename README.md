*Currently updating the readme.*

# ArtifactDB
The purpose of this repository is to provide an easy access to assets and information for developers creating & updating websites/tools for the game [Artifact by Valve](http://playartifact.com). Hopefully with enough people contributing we can fill out every card and keep it updated to track balance changes.
(Valve owns all art assets)

Currently there is all the known cards with art available for use, with a JSON manifest that can easily be integrated into your website/tool. If you spot something missing or wrong make a pull request!

# How can you contribute?
- Add new cards when they are announced
- Upload art
- Add card lore
- Add name of the artist

# JSON schema
I have tried to future proof the schema of the JSON manifest of changes by including expansion "Sets". Creep/Improvements/Items cards can have multiple abilities incase some point in the future they do.

*More info coming*
